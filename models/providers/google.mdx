### gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25
The latest comprehensive model supporting all features, with state-of-the-art capabilities. It offers text generation, web search, advanced reasoning, and robust coding features. It supports a wide range of input formats including PDF, images, audio, and video, and includes a context window of up to 1 million tokens (with expansion to 2 million tokens planned). Ideal for handling complex problems, deep multimodal understanding, and tasks requiring extensive data analysis. Available on the Free plan.

### gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25
A preview version of the next-generation comprehensive model, offering early access to cutting-edge features. It provides state-of-the-art capabilities similar to `gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25`, including text generation, web search, advanced reasoning, and robust coding features. It supports a wide range of input formats (PDF, images, audio, video) and has a 1 million token context window (expansion planned). Ideal for users wanting to experiment with the latest advancements for complex problems and deep multimodal understanding. Requires a Pro plan.

### gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17
A preview version of the next-generation Flash model, optimized for speed *and* reasoning. It offers fast text generation, web search, reasoning capabilities, and supports various inputs (PDF, images, audio, video). With a 1 million token context window, it's ideal for tasks requiring quick responses combined with analytical depth and multimodal understanding. Requires a Pro plan.

### gemini-2.0-flash
Previously `gemini-2.0-flash-001`. Optimized for speed, this model provides fast text generation and efficient web search functionality with support for PDF, image, audio, and video inputs, but lacks complex reasoning capabilities. With a context window of 1 million tokens, it's best suited for scenarios requiring quick, responsive interactions and moderate multimodal input handling. Now available on the Free plan.

### gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-01-21
A reasoning-focused, rapid-response model featuring advanced logical reasoning capabilities and multimodal support (PDF, images, audio, and video). This model does not include web search functionality but is optimized for tasks requiring analytical depth, critical thinking, and efficient multimodal reasoning within a context window of 1 million tokens. Available on the Free plan.

### gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05
A balanced, professional-level model offering robust text generation and effective web search capabilities. Supports multiple inputs such as PDF, image, audio, and video but excludes advanced reasoning capabilities. With a context window of 1 million tokens, it is well-suited for general multimodal generation and standard use cases. Available on the Free plan.
