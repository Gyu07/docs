*Please note that some features listed (like specific API functionalities e.g., fine-tuning, batch processing) may not be directly exposed or available within the Giselle interface even if supported by the underlying OpenAI model.*

## Reasoning Models

### o3-mini
A small model alternative to o3, offering fast and flexible reasoning capabilities. It provides high intelligence suitable for structured outputs, function calling, and tasks requiring strong reasoning. With a context window of 200,000 tokens and a maximum output of 100,000 tokens, it's optimized for intelligent reasoning, structured data extraction, and tasks demanding high token limits.

## Flagship Chat Models

### gpt-4o
The flagship GPT model providing comprehensive capabilities including advanced text generation, multimodal image input, integrated web search, and high-level reasoning features. It supports structured outputs and function calling. With a context window of 128,000 tokens and output limit of 16,384 tokens, it is ideal for complex analytical tasks, multimodal understanding, and general-purpose advanced applications.

## Cost-Optimized Models

### gpt-4o-mini
A fast, affordable small model optimized for focused tasks. Supports both text and image inputs with structured outputs and function calling capabilities. Ideal for tasks requiring moderate intelligence and rapid responses where cost is a primary consideration. Offers a context window of 128,000 tokens and output limit of 16,384 tokens.

## Model Selection Guide

Guidelines for selecting the optimal OpenAI GPT model within Giselle:

- **For comprehensive, high-intelligence tasks with multimodal needs**: `gpt-4o`
- **For cost-effective, focused tasks (including multimodal)**: `gpt-4o-mini`
- **For advanced reasoning and tasks requiring very high token limits**: `o3-mini`

## Practices for Giselle

We recommend **gpt-4o** as your primary model in Giselle. It offers an excellent balance of capability, intelligence, and versatility across various tasks, including business document creation, analysis, and research. With GPT-4o, you can produce professional-quality content while maintaining efficiency in both simple and complex workflows.
