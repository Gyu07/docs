## GitHub

### GitHub App Integration

You can enhance your Giselle workspace by installing the official Giselle GitHub App. This integration allows you to connect your GitHub repositories with Giselle, enabling seamless workflows between your code and Giselle's AI apps.

### GitHub Comment Attribution

When the Giselle GitHub App comments on GitHub issues, pull requests, or other GitHub elements, it automatically includes an attribution line at the end of each comment. This attribution appears as:

> âœ¨ Giselle App: [this-is-sample-app](https://example.com/giselle-sample-app-url)

This reference helps team members identify which Giselle app generated the comment and provides a direct link to access that specific app in your Giselle workspace. This feature enhances traceability and makes it easier to navigate between GitHub and your Giselle environment.
