## Giselle’s AI Agents Can Be Built by Combining “Nodes”

Giselle is a platform that allows you to build powerful AI agents through an intuitive node-based interface. By connecting "nodes" with various functions, like assembling building blocks, you can visually design complex AI workflows. This makes it easy for anyone, even without specialized knowledge, to achieve automation with AI agents.

## Introducing Giselle's Key Nodes

Here are some of the representative nodes available in Giselle. By combining these nodes, you can build various AI workflows.

### Text Generator Node

Text Generator node calls a text generation model and generates text. By setting prompts and conditions, you can generate text tailored to your purpose. It can be used for various applications such as document creation, writing blog posts, and generating research reports. Giselle's text generation utilizes the LLM API, allowing for the generation of high-quality and natural-sounding text.

### Text Node

Text node is used to hold text data. It can be used to record prompts, instructions, annotations, and more. It helps manage and organize text data within the workflow, streamlining input to text generation nodes and data usage in other nodes.

### File Node

File node is used to handle file data. You can read files, use them as input for AI models, and save output results to files. It is useful for various tasks that involve utilizing file data, such as data-based analysis and report generation.

Currently, the File node supports reading PDF files. We plan to support a wider variety of file formats in the future.

## Future Node Expansion Plans

At Giselle, we are planning to expand the node functionality to further empower our users in building AI workflows. Here's a look at what our team is currently considering:

### Addition of New Nodes

* **Image Generation node:** We will add a node that generates images from text prompts. This will enable creative content creation and the building of AI workflows that utilize visual data.

### Expansion of the File Node

We plan to expand the file formats supported by the File node, adding support for:

* **Image Files** (PNG, JPEG, etc.)
* **Tabular Files** (CSV, Excel, etc.)
* **Audio Files**

### Integration of Web Search Functionality

* **Web Search:** We will add web search functionality to the existing Text Generator node.
  * For example, we aim to allow the direct use of Gemini API's Grounding with Google Search feature from within a Giselle node.

Stay tuned for Giselle's product updates!
